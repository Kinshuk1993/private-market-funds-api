## Prompt 1: Review Task Docs and Update Service

**Date:** February 15, 2026

**Request:**

```text
Based on the task document and the requirements mentioned in API spec pdf and the take home task pdf file, what do you think about the code that is present in the titanbay-service directory? understand the requirements deeply and ultra think about it based on the take home task pdf file in Task directory. Then look at the API spec in the API pdf file in Task directory. Then based on that, understand what has been done which is present in the titanbay-service directory. Make the necessary changes based on the assumption that you are a staff software engineer at meta and need to complete this task to create this service which should be highly scalable, robust, reliable, consistent, should adhere to industry standard coding, principles like DRY, SOLID and other standard principles. Document what you are doing as you do it so i can read about it in a separate markdown updated.md file at the root of the directory so that i can review it later. The code that is generated by you should be production ready and deployable to production (don't focus on tests or writing them or anything about them yet). however make the documentation or comment related changed everywhere it is necessary and do enhancements and optimizations as you go and if there is some complex logic or special case that is present somewhere, document / comment it properly so it is maintainable.
```

**Context:**

- Added the initial task prompt to the log

## Prompt 2: Fix MD060 Markdown Violations

**Date:** February 15, 2026

**Request:**

```bash
/fix MD060/table-column-style: Table pipe is missing space to the right for style "compact"]
```

**Context:**
Fix markdown linting violations related to table column styling in the README.md file.

---

## Prompt 3: Fix All Violations in Two Markdown Files

**Date:** February 15, 2026

**Request:**

```bash
fix all violations in these 2 open markdown files.
```

**Context:**

- Files: `README.md` and `updated.md` (in titanbay-service directory)
- Fixed table separator spacing to satisfy MD060 violations in both files

---

## Prompt 4: Fix All Violations in Updated.md

**Date:** February 15, 2026

**Request:**

```bash
fix all violations in this markdown file
```

**Context:**

- File: `updated.md` (in titanbay-service directory)
- Fixed inconsistent table separator spacing in Section 8 (Endpoint Layer Changes)

---

## Prompt 5: Create AI-Prompts.md File

**Date:** February 15, 2026

**Request:**

```bash
based on the prompts that i have given, create a new AI-Prompt.md file and add the prompts that i have given as is. Going forward whenever i give new prompts, update that file. Keep it at the root of the directory structure.
```

**Context:**

- Created this file at the root of the TitanBay directory
- Logs all previous prompts given during this session
- Will be updated with new prompts as they are given

---

## Prompt 6: Initialize Git Repo and Push

**Date:** February 15, 2026

**Request:**

```text
for all the files and folders in this repo, initialize a git repo in the directory and push everything to the a new branch main at https://github.com/Kinshuk1993/private-market-funds-api.git
```

**Context:**

- Initialized a git repository and pushed the initial commit to main

## Prompt 7: Deep Review and Production Hardening

**Date:** February 15, 2026

**Request:**

```text
can you have a look at everything again in as detail as possible and ultra ultra think deep. You are a staff software engineer at meta. Look, analyse, understand the task directory for instructions on what the task is for the coding task, the API spec pdf document which contains the specifications (if you cannot read the pdf file, then i have a docx file equivalent for both of those, so read from that) and then look at the setup directory which was done using gemini 3.0 pro, then look at what the titanbay service directory - each file in it, study and understand and analyze it properly in as depth as possible. understand the whole context and what the code is doing and compare at every step with the requirements and then see if there are any things that are wrong, missing or can be improved upon in the current implementation. For all the changes you suggest and dom make a document for all those documenting all the changes with reasoning behind why those are needed and what impact it has including what will happen if they are not done right now. Consider making this app reliable, production ready, highly scalable, ready to serve millions of users concurrently across the globe, having ultra low latency and maintainable. Doing this, make sure it is also optimized and easy to understand, so visit every single file and make sure there are comments and documentation added for each of the code files and that every tricky bit of code is tracked.
```

**Context:**

- Read both task docx files (Take Home Task + API Spec) for full requirements
- Read every single source file in the titanbay-service directory
- Analyzed the 4 Gemini setup scripts to understand scaffolding history
- Identified 15+ improvements across compliance, scalability, reliability, and DX
- Created `updated-round2.md` documenting all changes with reasoning and impact
- Key changes: Decimal serialization fix, pagination on all endpoints, GZip/RequestID/Timing middleware, DB health check, TOCTOU race fix, deterministic ordering, dynamic year validation, `__repr__` on models, OpenAPI error schemas, `.env.example`, package docstrings
