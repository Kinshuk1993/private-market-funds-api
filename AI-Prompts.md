## Prompt 1: Review Task Docs and Update Service

**Date:** February 15, 2026

**Request:**

```text
Based on the task document and the requirements mentioned in API spec pdf and the take home task pdf file, what do you think about the code that is present in the titanbay-service directory? understand the requirements deeply and ultra think about it based on the take home task pdf file in Task directory. Then look at the API spec in the API pdf file in Task directory. Then based on that, understand what has been done which is present in the titanbay-service directory. Make the necessary changes based on the assumption that you are a staff software engineer at meta and need to complete this task to create this service which should be highly scalable, robust, reliable, consistent, should adhere to industry standard coding, principles like DRY, SOLID and other standard principles. Document what you are doing as you do it so i can read about it in a separate markdown updated.md file at the root of the directory so that i can review it later. The code that is generated by you should be production ready and deployable to production (don't focus on tests or writing them or anything about them yet). however make the documentation or comment related changed everywhere it is necessary and do enhancements and optimizations as you go and if there is some complex logic or special case that is present somewhere, document / comment it properly so it is maintainable.
